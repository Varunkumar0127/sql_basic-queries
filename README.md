Clear Outstanding of how to retrieve data
In this task, I worked with SQL SELECT statements to retrieve specific data from a table.
I used WHERE conditions with logical operators like AND, OR filter data effectively.
Pattern matching was performed using the LIKE operator, and range filtering using the BETWEEN clause.
I also applied the ORDER BY clause to sort results in ascending or descending order.
These queries helped in understanding data filtering and sorting in real-time scenarios.
